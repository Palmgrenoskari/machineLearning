# Machine Learning
Learning ML and its various subsets. Will put my projects in this repository! Aiming to do at least one project per topic.

## 1. Supervised Learning
Machine learns from training data.

### 1.1 Classification
Identify the category of new observations based on the training data.
### 1.2 Regression
Approximate and fit a function to the training data and then make predictions based on the function.

## 2. Unsupervised Learning
No training data is required. Machine figures out patterns on its own.

### 2.1 Clustering
Machine finds a structure or a pattern in the data
### 2.2 Dimensionality Reduction
Reduce the number of features in the data

## 3. Reinforcement Learning
Machine learns on its own through trial and error.
