# Fruit recognition using 3 different CNN architectures

## Work in progress...

* I'm using the fruits-360 dataset from kaggle but instead of 131 different fruits and vegetables I've reduced it to 21.
* I'm building 3 different CNN models to compare their performances
* Not using a base
* Models are saved elsewhere because they are too big for github. >100MB
* Models I'm currently working on:
    * RegNetx_002
    * VGG16
    * ResNet18
